## Introduction

VascuEye is a medical imaging system that utilizes near-infrared (NIR) technology to detect arteries and assist in both preoperative planning and post-surgical inspection for oral and facial surgeries. By providing real-time visualization of blood vessels, the system helps surgeons avoid accidental arterial damage and simplifies post-surgical monitoring to detect complications like hematomas or poor blood circulation.

### Applications & Benefits
- ✅ Enhanced Surgical Accuracy – Helps avoid arterial damage during procedures.
- ✅ Faster & Easier Post-Surgical Inspection – Reduces reliance on manual monitoring.
- ✅ Real-Time Blood Flow Monitoring – Detects complications early.
- ✅ Portable & Affordable Solution – More accessible than high-end imaging devices.
- ✅ Remote Monitoring Support – Enables telemedicine and second opinions.
